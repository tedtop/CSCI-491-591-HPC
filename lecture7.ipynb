        "### GPU Programming in Python\n",
        "* Fortunately, we don't necessarily need to write C or C++ code to use CUDA\n",
        "* There are a few Python packages for writing CUDA code that can take advantage of GPUs\n",
        "* We'll discuss two Python packages in particular\n",
        "\n",
        "#### CuPy — Essentially NumPy on the GPU\n",
        "* What it is: A NumPy-compatible array library whose ops run on the GPU.\n",
        "* How you use it: Replace NumPy as np with cupy as cp\n",
        "* Most NumPy code just works\n",
        "* Under the hood: Calls CUDA libraries (cuBLAS, cuSOLVER, cuFFT, cuSPARSE, cuRAND, etc.).\n",
        "* Capabilities\n",
        "  * Vectorized math, broadcasting, indexing, ufuncs\n",
        "  * Linear algebra (cp.linalg → cuBLAS/cuSOLVER), FFT (cp.fft → cuFFT), random (cp.random → cuRAND), sparse (cupyx.scipy.sparse → cuSPARSE).\n",
        "  * Custom kernels without leaving Python\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Numba - Writing Kernels in Python\n",
        "* What it is: A JIT compiler that turns a subset of Python into CUDA kernels\n",
        "* How you use it: Decorate functions with @cuda.jit (or create CUDA ufuncs with @vectorize(target=\"cuda\")).\n",
        "* Capabilities\n",
        "  * Full thread/block/grid control; launch with [blocks, threads].\n",
        "  * Shared memory, atomics, syncthreads(), warp intrinsics (e.g., shuffles), streams/events.\n",
        "  * Memory management: cuda.to_device, device_array, pinned and managed memory.\n",
        "* Best for writing custom kernels when no library op fits\n",
        "* Offers more fine-grained control over blocks/threads/shared memory—all in Python\n"
