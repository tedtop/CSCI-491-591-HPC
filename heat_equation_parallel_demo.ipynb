    "* The basic idea here is that we can break down the spatial domain into chunks and have each process responsible for computing the diffusion stencil for its own chunk.\n",
    "* Computing the diffusion stencil at a given cell involves the cells adjacent to it.\n",
    "* For most cells in the domain, this is fine, but what do we do at the edge of chunks?\n",
    "* We can't directly access data from a different, chunk, so we can use MPI to communicate between chunks. \n",
    "* In practice each process is responsible for doing compuatations on a given set of rows. Each row contains a subset of rows in the domain, plus top and bottom \"halo\" rows. \n",
    "* Rows from other ranks can be copied into these halos so that each process has all of the information it needs to compute the diffusion stencil on its chunk of the domain."
